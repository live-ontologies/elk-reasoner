The ELK Reasoner team is pleased to announce 
        the ELK Protege plug-in 0.6.1 release!

ELK is an ontology reasoner for the OWL 2 EL profile, currently with some 
limitations. For further information see
 
          https://github.com/liveontologies/elk-reasoner

Changes in this version:
------------------------
New features:
- Compute internal inferences for derived conclusions by repeating rule applications (tracing). 
- Initial translation of internal ELK inferences to OWL inferences. 
- Protege: new auto-synchronization option to update reasoning result immediately after changes. 
- Partial support of ObjectOneOf constructor. 
- Support of SameIndividual and DifferentIndividuals axioms. 
- Partial support of DisjointUnion axioms. 
- Partial support of ObjectPropertyRange axioms. 
- Support entailment checking for ClassAssertion, DifferentIndividuals, DisjointClasses, EquivalentClasses, ObjectPropertyAssertion, ObjectPropertyDomain, SameIndividual and SubClassOf axioms. 
- Implement extension points for the protege-proof-explanation plugin. 
- Implement extension points for the protege-proof-justification plugin. 
- Keep track of features that cause incompleteness of reasoning results. 
- Support positive occurrences of ObjectHasSelf. 
- Support OWL API 5.x.  Issue: 48. 
Fixed Bugs:
- Parse DataOneOf with one literal by functional-style parser.  Issue: 43. 
- Fix NumberFormatException when returning reasoner version.  Issue: 49. 
- Restore equality detection of some unsupported constructors.  Issue: 61. 
Changes:
- Avoid performing some redundant role chain rule applications. 
- Ensure that the set of derived conclusions does not depend on the order of rule applications. 
- Make index updates revertable to better handle unsupported language features. 
- Represent all OWL object types in internal OWL object model. 
- Improve the transitive reduction algorithm for taxonomy construction. 
- Protege: store preferences in Java preferences instead of a file. 
- Make taxonomy model more generic. 
- Convert internal inferences to OWL inferences using a recursive matching procedure. 
- Implement answering class expression and instance queries without introducing auxiliary classes. 
- Extend proof generation to entailment checking. 
- Add an option to inline proofs by combining nested inferences. 
- Add examples to inferences used in proofs. 
- Centralize interrupt management for all reasoning stages. 
- Share concurrent executor over all reasoner instances. 
- Implement recency and frequency caching policies. 
- Cache query results and proof inferences. 
- Improve reporting of incompleteness warnings and their explanations. 
- Improve incremental reasoning by avoiding re-computations after deletions.  Issue: 28. 
- Switch from log4j to logback. 
Removed:
- Protege: incremental mode is no longer experimental. 
- Drop support of Java 7. 
- Protege: remove popup notifications about unsupported reasoning tasks and incompleteness. 


Have fun!
